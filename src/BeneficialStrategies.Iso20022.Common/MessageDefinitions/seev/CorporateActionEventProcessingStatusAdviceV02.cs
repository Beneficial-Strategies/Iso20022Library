/// An account servicer sends the CorporateActionEventProcessingStatusAdvice message to an account owner or its designated agent to report processing status of a corporate action event.
/// The account servicer uses this message to provide a reason as to why a corporate action event has not been completed by the announced payment dates.
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate),
/// using the relevant elements in the business application header (BAH).|ISO 15022 - 20022 COEXISTENCE|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years.
