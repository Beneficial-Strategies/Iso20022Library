/// This record is an implementation of the seev.004.001.05 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// A party holding the right to vote sends the MeetingInstruction message to an intermediary, the issuer or its agent to request the receiving party to act upon one or several instructions.
/// Usage
/// The MeetingInstruction message is used to register for a shareholders meeting, request blocking or registration of securities. It is used to assign a proxy, to specify the names of meeting attendees and to relay vote instructions per resolution electronically.
/// The MeetingInstruction message may only be sent for one security, though several safekeeping places may be specified.
/// Once the message is sent, it cannot be modified. It must be cancelled by a MeetingInstructionCancellationRequest. Only after receipt of a confirmed cancelled status via the MeetingInstructionStatus message, a new MeetingInstruction message can be sent.
/// This message definition is intended for use with the Business Application Header.
