/// This record is an implementation of the pacs.007.001.03 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The FinancialInstitutionToFinancialInstitutionPaymentReversal message is sent by an agent to the next party in the payment chain. It is used to reverse a payment previously executed.
/// Usage
/// The FIToFIPaymentReversal message is exchanged between agents to reverse a FIToFICustomerDirectDebit message that has been settled. The result will be a credit on the debtor account.
/// The FIToFIPaymentReversal message may or may not be the follow-up of a CustomerDirectDebitInitiation message.
/// The FIToFIPaymentReversal message refers to the original FIToFICustomerDirectDebit message by means of references only or by means of references and a set of elements from the original instruction.
/// The FIToFIPaymentReversal message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.
