/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesSettlementAllegementRemovalAdvice to an account owner to acknowledge that a previously sent allegement is no longer outstanding, because the alleged party sent its instruction.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022.
